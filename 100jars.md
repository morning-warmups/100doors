##Winnie the Pooh's Honey Problem


Problem: You have 100 jars of honey in a row that are all initially closed. You make 100 visits to each jar of honey.

The first time around, you visit every jar and toggle the lid (if the jar is closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it).

The second time you only visit every 2nd jar of honey (jar #2, #4, #6, ...). The third time, every 3rd jar of honey (har #3, #6, #9, ...), etc, until you only visit the 100th jar of honey.



Question: What state are the jars of honey in after Pooh's last pass? Which are open, which are closed?
